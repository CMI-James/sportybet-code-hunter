In the age of modern cinema, a 72-year-old legend is consistently reinventing himself as an actor, and with each movie, he is striving to break new ground in Malayalam cinema. 

His name is Mammootty, who plays a gay man in #Kaathal. One of the best Malayalam movies of 2023.
It’s so odd how all these illegal immigrants coming over on these boats don’t have any kids or women with them.
cus it was shit

He complained too much about the migrants. The democrats sent their 3 letter agencies to finish him
You added an important word just before "friends at odd hours"

For some odd reason, coinbase stopped my polkadot staking service on Thanksgiving w/out my knowledge. Can someone explain what's going on before I take my business elsewhere? This is absurd.

Odd. I thought the disgraceful scenes in Dublin were tiny children being stabbed. 

Cause & effect. I don’t think burning your city & looting is wise, but Europe is being destroyed in front of us & what we are seeing is anger/despair & the knowledge it won’t stop, but accelerate

It’s odd that you think “lefties” are represented well on question time.  The bias is so far right there’s a permanent starboard list.
Have you seen any of the 44k hours of footage released? You know all the footage that showed cops letting people in and giving tours? J6 happened but it wasn't an insurrection like HAMAS supporters attempted not too long ago. Odd that you don't condemn terrorism.
There’s no right thing to say to people who are grieving, but the worst thing is fearing to speak at all | Gaby Hinsliff https://theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/24/grieving-bad-news?CMP=share_btn_tw… Pitch perfect. Silence, isolation, odd advice the almost universal experience.
Odd your tweets usually just comprise two words fuck being one them. The eloquence of this one suggests you haven't started drinking yet.

Seattle is 24th in designed rush rate at 36.1%. Their hand may have been forced in the second half vs. SF but they were the same rank/nearly the same % going into Week 12. Dating back to '22? Also 24th/36.5%. Odd for a team that planned to recommit to the run after trading Wilson
Selwood copped it a heap tho for ducking, despite playing 350 odd games, 4 flags and however many AA’s he was genuinely known mostly for ducking as a player of that calibre.

It's odd that people are more upset at damage to intimate objects than to children.

I imagine that if an Irishman stabbed random foreign children yesterday, you wouldn't be complaining about some public transport damaged in the following protests.
nitafutie odd ya kesho ni kulipe
Because even him no know the odd wey remain...
I binged season 3 a few hours ago. The standout episodes for me were The Very Pulse of the Machine and Jibaro. Jibaro's odd animation style and symbolism thick enough that you could touch it really made it stand out, but I feel as though it had too much going on.
censoring words to avoid Summoning Them but lots of h**ch*** shippers earnestly believe that the one and only reason anybody hcs ch***** as a lesbian is bc they're biphobic

The first paragraph where RSV is mentioned is really odd. The paragraphs before and after would flow together but the RSV bit seems like it has been added as an afterthought in an odd place.

As a trader and someone who’s been doing this for 8 years now, it is frustrating seeing others get engagement for posting literally nothing. That’s why most of the time I shitpost now and share the odd bit of wisdom. Save the rest for my group. Because what’s the point lol.

 something odd is happening here on X, almost every time I mention certain words, this happens! It’s almost like there’s an algorithm at work! It happens so frequently, I’ve lost count!
Fate is like a strange, unpopular restaurant filled with odd little waiters who bring you things you never asked for and don't always like.

Yeah, every step of the way Poilievre keeps getting advice he doesn’t follow, and oddly enough his popularity just continues to grow.

Odd, huh?

This is very odd? Which of the three parties? What happened to following proper procedures? $6 million is an enormous amount of funding to simply dish out without following process?

Given the tragedy and brutality of the events you talk about it's a bit odd to make jokes and to make meme about yourself.
Agreed that there will only be one crypto punk.  I'll be curious to see how much provenance really matters in the end but you're right that people have an odd obsession with it right now
Criticism is actually very healthy, it’s odd that people can switch up on you just for that, when they could just take the critique, improve and prove everyone wrong
Think I might be #done with sex pervert Twitter. Was hilarious a few years ago but now it’s just everyone trying to outdo each other for depravity. The odd belter mind

Editing it didn’t really do any good so it looks a little odd.
